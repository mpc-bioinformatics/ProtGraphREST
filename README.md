# [WIP] ProtGraphREST
A protein graph REST-API to query generated graphs from [ProtGraph](https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/ProtGraph).

This project currently only allows to query peptides from already known paths. Therefor, there is only one possible query-point.

## REST-API
To query a peptide (with a given path), access the following url: `<url>/ACCESSION/path_to_pep?path=0,2,4,177`. 
It will return the peptide in plain text, which can be then parsed. It is also possible to query multiple paths at once, yielding then 
a new line seperated list of the corresponding peptides.

## Examples: 

```shell
curl http://localhost:8000/A0A4S5AXF8/path_to_pep?path=0,13,14,15,16,245
VASS

curl http://localhost:8000/A0A4S5AXF8/path_to_pep?path=0,13,14,15,16,245&path=0,14,15,16,17,245
VASS
ASSM
```

## Startup

To start this project, clone it first via `git`.

Install the dependencies via `pipenv install` and start the shell with: `pipenv shell`

Currently the entrypoint is: `main.py`

To start ProtGraphREST, you need to specificy a base folder, which contains exported `pickle` files from [ProtGraph](https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/ProtGraph).
Make sure to export those graphs via the additonal argument (`-edirs`), so that ProtGraphREST can access the generated graphs.

Example: 
Graphs were or are currently generated by ProtGraph in `/test/examples/` (via `-epickle`, `edirs`)

Simply run: `python main.py /test/examples` and the services are then available.
